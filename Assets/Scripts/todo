pouring!

depth testing
---> use shader to get depth buffer....
---> 
color based on speed/turbulence

actualy simulate particles like water!

async dispatch + set data (water is one frame behind physics?)
acceleration data structure

depth tracking / nearest farther... for occlusion but also shading
shader work

blur based on distance.... (the closer the more blur....)
